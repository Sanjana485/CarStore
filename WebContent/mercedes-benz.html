									<p>The All-New Third Generation Mercedes-Benz CLS is finally available in India following its global unveil at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show. The new Mercedes-Benz CLS is available in India with the CLS300d engine and features the latest all-new Mercedes-Benz design language as compared to the likes of the current range of Mercedes-Benz vehicles including the C-Class, E-Class or S-Class. The CLS is essentially the 4-door coupe version of the S-Class and is very well appointed on the inside with the best materials, high end leather interior packages and of course, a whole bunch of cutting edge technology.</p>
									<p>As mentioned, the Mercedes-Benz CLS in India gets a 300d diesel engine – similar to the one available on the likes of the C300d facelift in India. The engine makes 241 bhp of peak power and also makes 500 Nm of maximum torque. The new CLS also features the new 9-speed gearbox and is offered in India only in a rear wheel drive format. The current CLS lineup will also eventually get a petrol engine option, most likely the CLS450 – like the engine on the S-Class along with an AMG option. That said, unlike previous models, the new CLS will not be getting a CLS 63 AMG version but will instead have a CLS 53 AMG that will be the range topper with its hybrid powertrain.</p>
									<p>The New Mercedes-Benz CLS features a completely new design language. The car is more angular as compared to any other previous CLS and features a lot more aggressive lines too. The new CLS also features the iconic 4-door coupe design language, something that the CLS pioneered in the early 2000s and was followed by the likes of the Audi A7 and the BMW 6-Series GranCoupe later on. The new CLS also features an all-new interior that gets the likes of the jet engine inspired AC vents that also feature ambient lighting and a large central screen for the infotainment system. The instrument cluster too is all-digital.</p>
									<p>With its "four-door coupe" shape, the first CLS sparked a sleek new era in car design. With standard AMG styling, 19-inch wheels and LED lighting, the 3rd-generation CLS is in better shape than ever.A flowing sculpture of leather, wood and satin aluminum, the CLS cabin welcomes you to space and style. The roomy rear cabin offers seating for three. Shapely front seats envelop you in artful design and advanced comfort.The CLS entices you with a rich palette of leathers and woods, and 64 colors of LED ambient lighting, even in the dash vents. Available Air Balance can infuse purified cabin air with subtle fragrance.</p>
									<p>Smartphone-like Touch Controls let you swipe and select features and settings from the steering wheel. A new touchscreen and a console touchpad offer additional, intuitive fingertip controls.Dual 12.3-inch screens are visually and functionally seamless: A central multimedia touchscreen for navigation, entertainment and many comfort settings. And a digital instrument cluster with reconfigurable displays.Innovative EQ Boost electrifies an exuberant turbo inline-6 to benefit power, torque, efficiency and emissions all at once. And thrill the driver all the time.</p>
