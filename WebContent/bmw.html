									<p>There's nothing better than putting the top down on a nice day and finding an entertaining road to enjoy, and the 2021 BMW Z4 is a great choice for such an activity. Buyers can choose between a turbocharged four-cylinder or a twin-turbo inline-sixâ€”the latter of which blasted the Z4 to 60 mph in just 3.8-seconds at our test track. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive isn't offered but, sadly, neither is a manual transmission; all Z4s come with an eight-speed automatic. Dynamically speaking, the Porsche Boxster is still our preferred ragtop sports car but the Z4 offers plenty of driving enjoyment with a slightly smoother ride for day-to-day use. The cabin is snug but comfortable for two adults and has plenty of standard creature comforts and connectivity features. If you'd prefer a fixed-roof coupe, check out the mechanically similar Toyota Supra instead. Toyota collaborated with BMW on it, and the two cars share their powertrains and suspensions.</p>
									<p>Few changes are in store for BMW's two-seat convertible for 2021. All models now come standard with SiriusXM satellite radio and Android Auto. Parking sensors have been added to the optional Driving Assistance package and the price has been adjusted up from $500 to $700 accordingly. Other minor changes include the addition of an optional wireless smartphone charging pad and M Sport brakes with red-painted calipers.</p>
									<p>Every 2021 BMW Z4 has an eight-speed automatic transmission with Sport mode as well as Manual mode. Paddle shifters mounted to the steering wheel are also standard. That's right: For the first time, the BMW Z4 is not available with a traditional manual transmission with a clutch pedal. You won't miss it. The eight-speed is one of the best automatics around with sharp responses, snappy shifts, and smooth operation. The sDrive30i is powered by the brand's excellent turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes plenty of torque and 255 horsepower. In our testing, this model accelerated to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. That's quick, but it's a bit slower than a Porsche Boxster, which is still available with a manual gearbox. For more grunt, the M40i model gets a 382-hp twin-turbocharged inline-six. It's incredibly smooth and refined, and it turns the Z4 into a superfast sports car with a zero-to-60-mph time of just 3.8 seconds. That's quicker than the 350-hp Porsche Boxster S.</p>
									<p>As is the case with all current BMWs, the 2021 BMW Z4 has a very high-quality interior. In fact, it may have the best interior in this class. It features luxe materials, exceptional panel fitment, and excellent control placement. Its seats are comfortable with sizable bolsters to hold you in place when you're enjoying the Z4's dynamics. There is also more room inside than you might expect, even for those taller than six feet. Thick and insulated, its cloth roof seals tightly. When the top is up, the BMW's interior is impressively quiet, with so little wind or road noise it almost feels like a Grand Touring coupe. With the push of a button, it folds away in a few seconds. A wind blocker is standard to keep wind buffeting to a minimum with the top down, even at high speeds. Interior stowage is also quite generous. There are several storage bins around the Z4's cabin, including one in the center console and a felt-lined cubby to the left of the steering wheel. There's also a netted shelf behind the seats and two big cupholders up front. At 10 cubic feet, the trunk of the Z4 isn't huge, but it'll swallow luggage for two for a quick weekend road trip.</p>
