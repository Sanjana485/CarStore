									<p>If the amazing Lamborghini Urus is too expensive or too flashy for you, the 2022 Audi RS Q8 offers a similar package and nearly identical performance. The reason for the similarities is the close mechanical ties between these two top-tier hyper-performance SUVs. Although the Audi's version of their shared twin-turbo V-8 makes 50 fewer horsepower, its acceleration virtually as breathtaking. Despite commanding a six-digit transaction price the Audi could and should be considered a performance bargain considering that it costs about half as much as the Lambo. Inside, the RS Q8 offers the same tech-forward cabin we've come to expect from modern Audis, with a dual touchscreen infotainment setup, an all-digital gauge cluster, and plenty of other gadgets. While we'll stop short of calling it the ultimate Audi—that title belongs to either the R8 sports car or the RS6 Avant station wagon—it's most definitely the ultimate Audi SUV.</p>
									<p>Audi's most badass SUV is mostly unchanged for 2022 except for a few new standard driver-assistance features, including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. The optional Executive package now includes traffic sign recognition and an Intersection Assist feature, while a new RS-Design package is available and includes carpeted floormats with the RS logo, striped seatbelts, and faux-suede Alcantara upholstery on the center console, steering wheel, and shift knob.</p>
									<p>The RS Q8 has a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine that produces 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. It pairs with the Quattro all-wheel-drive system and an eight-speed automatic, and there's also a 48-volt hybrid system to improve fuel efficiency. Audi claims a zero-to-60-mph time of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 189 mph. We're looking forward to testing this claim at our test track when an RS Q8 visits our office for testing. In November 2019, Audi set a record at the Nürburgring race course with a camouflaged prototype of the RS Q8.</p>
									<p>The Audi Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster and dual-touchscreen MMI interface have certain RS-specific displays that can show information such as torque and power output, lap times, and g-forces. Other than that, we expect the same technology offered in the Q8, including standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, navigation, and SiriusXM satellite radio.</p>
									<p>Audi offers several driver-assistance systems on the RS Q8 as standard, including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist.
