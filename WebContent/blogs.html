                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/01-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>Winter is quickly approaching and that means fewer hours of daylight. To be sure you can be seen by others and your visibility is not compromised, check your vehicle’s lights and wipers, says the non-profit Car Care Council.

“The days are getting shorter, so it is a good time to check that your vehicle’s wipers and lighting are working properly because the chance of an accident increases if you can’t see or be seen,” said Nathan Perrine, executive director, Car Care Council. “From the driver’s seat you may not notice a light that isn’t working, so check all of your car’s lights and replace those that are out. Also, be sure to inspect and replace wiper blades so you can see clearly when wet weather hits.”

The wiper system keeps excessive water, snow and dirt from building up on the windshield, maintaining clear visibility. Many factors can accelerate the replacement interval of wipers, including operating conditions (winter conditions are tough on wiper blades), frequency of use, material and type of wipers and sunny weather. In fact, wiper blades can deteriorate faster and need more frequent replacement in desert states.

Lights are normal wear items that require periodic inspection and replacement. The lighting system provides nighttime visibility; signals and alerts other drivers; and supplies light for viewing instruments and the vehicle’s interior. In addition to replacing dimming, rapidly blinking and non-functioning lights, the following tips can help keep you safe:

</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If there is any doubt on whether or not your headlights should be on, turn them on. Lights not only help you see better in early twilight, they also make it easier for other drivers to see you.</li>
                                        <li>Keep headlights, tail lights and signal lights clean. External dirt and debris can dim operational lights from being seen by others.</li>
                                        <li>Make sure that your headlights are properly aimed. Misaimed headlights blind other drivers and reduce your ability to see the road.</li>
                                        <li>Don’t overdrive your headlights; you should be able to stop inside the illuminated area, otherwise you are creating a blind crash area in front of your vehicle.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Car Scrappage policy Announced!</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/02-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>The Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, has announced the vehicle scrappage policy in the Lok Sabha. The Minister said scrapping older vehicles and recycling them will be a win-win policy for everyone.

Gadkari claimed, “This policy will enable setting up of scrap centres.” According to him, the scrapping centres will benefit car and bike makers as well as component makers.

The scheme will provide incentives to owners of old vehicles to scrap unfit vehicles via registered scrapping centres. Some of the incentives outlined by the Road Transport Ministry include:

Scrap value given by scrapping centre is approximately 4-6 percent of the ex-showroom price of new vehicles.
The state governments may be advised to offer a road-tax rebate of upto 25 percent for personal vehicles.
Manufacturers will be advised to provide a discount of 5 percent on buying new vehicles against a scrapping certificate.
In addition, the Ministry is also considering waiving registration fees of new vehicles against the scrapping certificate.
He outlined the development plans and added that scrapping will also reduce the cost of vehicle components, “Within 5 years, India will become an automobile hub, in the coming times, auto parts will cost less and the government is promoting electric vehicles.”

Speaking about the new policy with regards to vintage and classic cars, Autocar India's resident classic car expert, Perseus Bandrawalla, said, "Voluntary scrapping comes as a relief for classic car owners and enthusiasts. It's not just that classic cars are an important part of automotive history, but also that the history of the motor car is an important chapter in the history of the world. This scheme should also encourage owners to keep their cars in good condition."

Viveck Goenka, President, Western India Automobile Association (WIAA), said, "The new scrappage  policy, without being coercive, will discourage the use of polluting and gas guzzling cars. Those who want to preserve Young Classics and those who want to keep old cars for sentimental reasons are free to do so, albeit at a price, either by paying high fitness fees or by  environment friendly conversions of their vehicles. This is an environment-friendly and thoughtful initiative by the government, and will also increase road safety. We should all welcome it."

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will promote setting up Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility (RVSF) across India and will encourage private participation for opening such centres. Similarly the Ministry will promote setting up of Automated Fitness Centres on a PPP model by the state government, private sector automobile companies and the like.

Appointment for fitness centres may be booked online and tests reports shall also be generated in an electric mode. The tentative timeline for application of the proposed Scrappage Policy is -

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">YOUR BRAKES AND WHY PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE HELPS!!</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/03-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>The brakes are a major component of any functional vehicle and it is important to keep a check on them at all times. This is why preventative maintenance goes a long way.

Here is a look at what needs to be done to keep the braking system in good shape.
<br><b>Do it Right, Not DIY:</b>
It is common to go through maintenance work on your own. While this is okay for some, it can lead to dangerous outcomes that can endanger your life behind the wheel. As a result, it is better to get professionals to take a look at the braking system and each component in detail. This will ensure appropriate preventative measures are taken.

Even something as simple as brake pad replacements can be tricky if you don’t have the requisite expertise. It is always a good thing to get your brakes looked at once a year and possibly replaced.  The next time you get your tires rotated ask us to take a look at your brakes too.  There is nothing more important to us than your safety and we will make sure that when you leave us your car is safer than when you first brought it in.

<br><b>Flush Your Brake Fluid When Needed:</b>
It is difficult to understand what your options are when it comes to a vehicle’s brakes. In general, it is important to flush your brake fluid whenever it’s necessary. To do this, you are going to have to depress the brake pedal, let the pressure build-up, and then have it push the fluid through to the brake lines and calipers.

Over time, it is possible the moisture inside the braking system can cause serious damage. This tends to happen as the brakes start to age.

This is why it is highly recommended to set a schedule and change the brake fluid every 25,000 miles to make sure everything is in working order. This is the best way to feel good about how the vehicle ages and whether or not you are safe behind the wheel.

The best way to see whether or not this is needed is to look at the quality of the brake fluid. If it is milky/cloudy then it has to be changed as soon as possible.

If you are on top of this from day one, it is possible to continue to extend the life of the brakes. This is a must when trying to do things the right way without compromising your safety.

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">UNDERSTANDING CAR HEATING AND COOLING PROBLEMS</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/04-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>While the heating and the air conditioning systems in your car are connected, they are two different systems and function separately. Nonetheless, like every part or system in a vehicle, car owners need to take care of the heating and A/C systems. Regular maintenance is of utmost importance to keep both systems in good working order and extend the lifespan of your car. Importantly, scheduled maintenance negates the risk of nagging gremlins affecting your vehicle’s heating and A/C system.

Being vehicle heating and cooling systems experts, we understand and appreciate the value of taking care of these systems. As such, we use our comprehensive multi-point check procedures and processes to ensure every part or subsystem in the A/C or heating system functions effectively and efficiently. Whether your car A/C stopped working suddenly, or you face a problem that gradually gets worse, we will get to the bottom of the issue and solve it.

<br><b>Common Issues With The A/C System:</b><br>
• <u>Low Refrigerant</u> – This is one of the most common issues that a vehicle A/C system faces. A sign of low refrigerant levels is the car air conditioner making noise and not cooling. Depending on the refrigerant level, the A/C might blow cool or even warm air, but not cold. Facing such a situation during summer is not a pleasant experience. You need a coolant top-up. Depending on your vehicle’s make and model is either R-12 or R-134a.

<br>• <u>Clogged Or Leaking Condenser</u> – When the A/C does not have ample refrigerant coursing through the system as per the OEM design, you will not get any cooled air coming from the vents. Condenser leaks can reduce the effectiveness of the A/C. Additionally, crud build-up at the front of the condenser will restrict the flow of refrigerant. Consequently, the car air conditioner may make noise and not work.

<br>• <u>Damaged Compressor</u> – The A/C condenser is the device wherein heat exchange occurs, allowing the A/C system to dump heat outside. For the condenser to function efficiently, it `is placed in the front of the vehicle, which leaves it vulnerable to damage from getting hit by objects such as rocks. If a knock ruptures the condenser and it’s leaking refrigerant, it needs to be replaced immediately to negate further damage to the system.

<br>Another common issue that are A/C systems face is a Broken Belt.

<br><b>Common Reasons For The Heating System Not to Work:</b><br>
• <u>Low Coolant</u> – Your car uses the heat drawn from the coolant engine to warm up the cabin. The coolant is drawn from the engine block, passes through the heater core. At the heater core, heat transfers from the coolant to the air that’s blown to the cabin. Low coolant levels tend to reduce the efficiency of heat evacuation from the engine. This reduces the amount of heat available at the heater core.

<br>• <u>Air In The Coolant System</u> – Having air traverse the coolant system reduces its efficiency. Water can take a lot more air from the engine block than air. As such, when air is trapped within the coolant lines, the cooling system is unable to evacuate enough to warm up the cabin. This is also dangerous to the engine due to the risk of overheating.

<br>• <u>Malfunctioning Heater Core</u> – The heater core is a mini radiator made of aluminum or brass tubing that allows coolant drawn from the engine to circulate. The heat in the heater core is blown by fans, helping to disperse heat into the cabin, keeping this space toasty warm. Unfortunately, the heater core is prone to a myriad of problems such as clogged tubing, fan-blown air not reaching the heater core, or cooler not moving efficiently within the heater core. It is paramount to have this critical part of the heating system regularly maintained.

<br>• <u>Failed (Or Malfunctioning) Thermostat</u> – When faced with a thermostat malfunction or failure, the heater may work intermittently or not work. In such cases, the best course of action is to replace the thermostat.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">10 MOST IMPORTANT DRIVING LESSONS FOR A NEW DRIVER</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/05-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>For a new driver, getting their driver’s license is a right of passage. Nevertheless, with the new freedom and independence that comes with driving, there’s also new responsibility. It also comes with a number of hazards that can lead to car accidents and other dangerous situations if your driver doesn’t handle them right.

Talking with them and making them aware of potential dangers can help keep them stay safe and prepared for any situation they may face on the road.

The following are some important driving lessons that you may not think twice about, but that can help your new driver prevent being in a car accident:


<br>
<b>1. Always Wear Your Seatbelt</b><br>
It’s tempting to skip the seatbelt on short trips to the corner store. However, a car accident can happen any time you’re on the road, and you’re far more likely to be seriously injured if not wearing a seat belt.


<br>
<b>2. Check Your Blindspots</b><br>
While the rear and side-view mirrors can give you a good idea of what’s behind you while driving, remind your peer that there are still blind spots. Always check your blind spots when backing up or changing lanes.


<br>
<b>3. Don’t Drive In Other People’s Blindspots</b><br>
Just as important as checking your own blindspots, is to avoid driving where other cars can’t see you. This defensive driving technique is one that will keep your peer from having a car accident. If you’re driving along the side and slightly behind another car, they may not be able to see you.


<br>
<b>4. Be Aware of Pedestrians and Anything On the Road</b><br>
When driving, it’s easy to become so focused on other cars and the rules of the road that you just don’t see pedestrians, bikers, or other things that are on the road. It helps to remind your peer to be aware of other things on the road besides cars.


<br>
<b>5. Put Your Phone Away</b><br>
The most common cause of distracted driving is people checking their phones, texting while driving, and other digital distractions. Our phones should be put away while we drive. If you need to check your phone for any reason, it’s okay to pull over. Stop for a minute and answer your messages; once you’re done, you can continue driving.

Researchers say that every time you write and send a text, your eyes are off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds. This is enough time to drive the length of a football field. Remind your peer always to keep their eyes on the road no matter what.
<br>
<b>6. Keep Passengers to a Minimum</b><br>
When your peer is just starting to drive on their own, you may want to make a rule against driving with passengers, at least for the first few months. Passengers in the car can be a big distraction. Plus, if those passengers are friends of your peer, they may pressure them to drive too fast and make risky decisions.


<br>
<b>7. Never Drive When You’re Tired or Upset</b><br>
If your peer is angry when they drive, they’re much more likely to make risky decisions on the road. Honestly, this is a good rule for all drivers as we cannot focus on the road when our minds are somewhere else.

The same goes for being tired. Fatigued drivers cause many car accidents. In fact, some experts say that driving while you’re sleepy is equally as dangerous as driving while under the influence of alcohol.


<br>
<b>8. Don’t Drink and Drive</b><br>
It’s likely your peer has heard this a million times, but they must never drive under the influence. Although you may be tempted to avoid talking about alcohol and drugs, it’s an issue that almost every peer has to face at some point. Set firm expectations upfront about drinking and driving and stick to them.


<br>
<b>9. Use Your Headlights</b><br>
You can’t control other drivers, but you can make it easier for them to see you. Turning on your headlights, even during the day, is one thing you can do to help avoid car accidents on the road.

Obviously, you should use your headlights at night. Still, there are many other driving conditions where your headlights can be helpful, such as early mornings and evenings when the sun affects visibility.


<br>
<b>10. Follow the Speed Limit</b><br>

Speeding is the leading cause of accidents for all drivers, but especially for peers. Remind your peer driver that no one is pressuring them to drive fast, and there’s no need to keep up with others on the road who choose to drive recklessly. Let them pass and stick to the speed limit.

What’s more, speeding tickets can be costly and raise car insurance premiums. Following the speed limit is one of the most important rules of the road when it comes to avoiding a car accident.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">8 AMAZING FACTS ABOUT AUTOMOBILES!</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/06-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p> Here are some fun and interesting facts regarding cars!!
                                      <br><b>1. Henry Ford came up with the phrase “tune-up” when he was working on his first automobile prototype.</b><br> The first ignition system was made up of spark plugs and ignition coils. As these coils worked they would emit a buzzing sound, and if they were all working together correctly they would all buzz at the same level and be “in tune.” If they weren’t working together, this meant the vehicle wasn’t running it’s best, and these coils needed to be adjusted – or tuned-up – to make the car run better. Today we still use the phrase “tune-up” for auto maintenance services that can help improve a car’s engine performance.

<br><b>2. The average Indian spends about 38 hours a year stuck in traffic.</b><br> That means by the time you turn 60, you’ll have spent 95 DAYS stuck in traffic, assuming of course that traffic doesn’t get worse at all. Do we really not have flying cars yet?

<br><b>3. There was a monk in the 1200s who predicted the existence of cars.</b><br> Roger Bacon was a Franciscan friar who lived from around 1214-1292. In one of his documents he wrote: “Cars can be made so that without animals they will move with unbelievable rapidity.” He also predicted airplanes, steamships, submarines and scuba diving suits!

<br><b>4. 75% of cars that Rolls Royce has produced are still on the road today.</b><br> That’s an amazing feat, and a testament to a quality car, and lower mass production.

<br><b>5. There is one place in the world where a boat can sail underneath a train, while the train is driving underneath a car that is driving underneath an airplane.</b><br> The place where all of these modes of transportation can align is the Boston University Bridge in Boston, Massachusetts.

<br><b>6. It was once against the law to slam your car door in a city in Switzerland.</b><br> Technically speaking, it is still against the law to slam your door, as the law forbids making “unnecessarily loud and disruptive noise” between the hours of 11pm and 6am.

<br><b>7. In 1916, 55% of all the cars in the WORLD were Model T Fords.</b><br> This record has never been broken.

<br><b>8. The average car is made up of 30,000 parts.</b><br> It’s not wonder that the automotive repair profession has become so much more complex and technical. Make sure you choose a top-notch auto repair shop that employs mechanics who really know what they are doing! </p>
